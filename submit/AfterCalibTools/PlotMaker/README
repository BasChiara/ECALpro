First of all, use script makeDirWWW.sh to create directories in your cern website. There you will store plots.
- Remember to change settings before launching the script (see comments inside)

Then, you can use calibAna.sh: this script will compile calibAnaEB.C and calibAnaEE.C and then run the executables.
- passing option -c as "source calibAna.sh -c" will only compile the macros.
- in calibAna.sh you have to properly set parameters used to run the macros (see comments inside)
- in both calibAnaEB.C and calibAnaEE.C, you have to change the variable 'wwwPath' which hold the path to the afs folder associated to your website.
- you might find easier to gather these two macros in a single one and select EB or EE with an option or flag (work in progress, but feel free to implement it yourself)
- also, notice that currently a TChain of root file is used to make plots. This TChain is made using *calibMap.root files on eos (31 for EB and 8 for EE). Since we also have the merged file, we could directly use that one instead of creating a TChain, but note that variables inside the ntuples in the merged file end with "_" (this is not true for the unmerged file used in the TChain, I don't know why) so you should change the name of trees'variables used if you want to run on the merged ntuples.

drawFits.C and drawICmap.C are similar to calibAnaE*.C macros: they can be used with the scripts drawFits.sh and drawICmap.sh
- again as already said above, there are some paths that you should change inside the macros to match your own folders, like 'storePath' in drawFits.C and wwwPath in drawICmap.C

GENERAL COMMENT:
- One thing to be improved is the palette for the 2D maps. We could use a finer binning in the z axis, and also a different color scale (rainbow one?) than the default (which currently goes from blue to yellow)

Feel free to modify and make this macros better ;-)
